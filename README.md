# The deported Ecuadorians

This repository includes the analysis of the data on arrests and deportations from the US focusing in Ecuadorian nationals. The information for this analysis is the one obtained by the [Deportation Data Project[(https://deportationdata.org/)], from the University of Berkley, California, directly from ICE through a FOIA request.

This project seeks to analyse the trend in arrests and deportations of Ecuadorian people in the US, since in the past three to four years there has been an increase in irregular inmigration through the Mexican border.

To perform this analysis, I focused in two datasets available: arrests and removals (deportations).

The key findings are:
- Since Donald Trump took office, there has been an increase in arrests related to inmigration matters. Ecuadorians are eight in the list of number of detainees.
- During this administration, more that 3.900 Ecuadorians have been deported. Most of them didn't have a conviction or faced criminal charges.
- Most of the deportees are men, between 20 and 40 years old.
- Ecuadorians are the top nationality for arrests in the states of New York and New Jersey.

The analysis can be found in the Jupyter Notebook in this repository, and the published version of this findings can be found [in this page](https://tefaceli.github.io/deportation-ecuadorians/), that includes data visualization in D3 and ai2html.

To deepen into this topic, futures steps include:
- Gathering information about flight carring deportees from Ecuador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
- Gathering information about deportees location and work status in Ecuador.
- Finding interviews with people tho have been deported back to Ecuador.
